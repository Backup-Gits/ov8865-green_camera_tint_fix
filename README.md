# ov8865-green_camera_tint_fix

This is based on the same fix by nullbytepl that he did on s2 here:
https://github.com/nullbytepl/android_vendor_leeco_s2/commit/72a5003a14f74c9ea3c4933611b73bc2a876e01a

The command I used to dump the blobs was this:
hexdump -Cv libmmcamera_ov8865.so > libmmcamera_ov8865.so.hex.txt
